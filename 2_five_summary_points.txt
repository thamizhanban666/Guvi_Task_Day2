How Does Browser Works :

=>  Browser actually creates the rendered tree for both HTML and CSS from given HTML page, then from the
    rendered tree it creates layout of coded HTML and finally does painting from the CSS style we coded.

=>  The responsibility of the rendering engine is well... Rendering, that is display of the requested 
    contents on the browser screen. By default the rendering engine can display HTML and XML documents 
    and images.

=>  The rendering engine will start parsing the HTML document and convert elements to DOM nodes in a tree 
    called the "content tree". The engine will parse the style data, both in external CSS files and in 
    style elements. Styling information together with visual instructions in the HTML will be used to 
    create another tree: the render tree.

=>  The job of the HTML parser is to parse the HTML markup into a parse tree.

=>  While the DOM tree is being constructed, the browser constructs another tree, the render tree. 
    This tree is of visual elements in the order in which they will be displayed. It is the visual 
    representation of the document. The purpose of this tree is to enable painting the contents in 
    their correct order.
